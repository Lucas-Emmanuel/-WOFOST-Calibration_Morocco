** CROP DATA FILE for use with WOFOST Version 5.4, June 1992
**
** WHEAT, WINTER 107
** Regions : Southern Spain (RB6) and Central and Southern Greece (RA2, RA3)
** start date 1 January
** mean date of flowering: 10-25 May, mature 5-25 July

** Derived from SUCROS87 data set for wheat.  
** Calibrated for use in WOFOST model at the Centre for Agrobiological 
** Research (CABO-DLO) for the simulation of crop growth and yield on the 
** basis of daily weather data.
** Purpose of application: Crop growth monitoring with agrometeorological 
** model in the EC.
** Developed in the framework of JRC Agriculture Project Action 3.
